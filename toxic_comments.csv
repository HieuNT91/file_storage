d8a64df4f787e25c,"""similar statement was made about methane. I revised using """"widely considered"""" and """"purported"""" to be consistent with the idea of making the statements less absolute. I recognize weasel wording dilemmas, but seriously, this accurately portrays the qualitative information without misleading.  
Not necessary. The """"debate"""" over global warming is long over. The """"debate"""" was a farce created by the people who wanted to pretend that it didn't exist. There is no reason to cater to them. It's an insult to honesty and good science.  

If we're talking about this part:
It is the largest single source of fuel for the generation of electricity world-wide, as well as one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide emissions, which is considered the primary cause of global warming. Coal is extracted from the ground by coal mining, either underground mining or open pit mining (surface mining).
Then I don't see a problem with the global warming statement (except """"is considered"""" isn't specific), but saying it is """"one of the largest sources"""" is a weasel approach and sounds uninformed.  I will try to improve. - (talk • contribs) 

Amount of coal remaining
""""At the current global total energy consumption of 15 terawatt,[30] there is enough coal to provide the entire planet with all of its energy for 57 years.""""  This sentence is not supported, and ignores the growth in coal consumption trends, and is therefore unencyclopedic. Please support it per WP:RS or it will be removed shortly.   
Actually the only reason it is there is because someone else had the questionable statement that coal could provide the entire planet with all of its energy for 600 years, which was based on the typographical error that has been fixed. Feel free to remove. The source was simple arithmetic of the numbers given.  

support for 57 years:  Goodell, Jeff.  Big Coal. Houghtom Mifflin Co. Boston, 2006  —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 207.195.244.104  21:07, August 21, 2007 (UTC)

""""by country"""" articles
Are the any articles that break up coal power by country like we have for renewables and nuclear? - (talk • contribs) 

 largest source of carbon dioxide 

since when was this true. Oil and it's bi-products exceed by far any other source of energy when it comes to CO2 emmisions. Someone needs to change that statement.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.234.149.235   
The article does not say anywhere that coal is the largest source, it says it is one of the largest sources. Coal and oil are so close to each other that it is not easy to definitively say that either is the largest. Coal is also increasing much faster than oil, which is likely to be declining soon, if it hasn't already begun to decline.  

 Question about units 
The article sometimes measures coal consumption in tonnes (metric tons, one tonne = 1000 kg) and sometimes in tons, which could be either the short ton (2000 lb) or the long ton (2200 lb).  (See the section, """"Coal as Fuel"""".)   Is this change intentional or simply a typo?

  Venue suggestion needed for a meet-up in Yuen Long


Dear:  ： 

In the past meet-ups, we always had our meeting in the centre of Kowloon, either Kowloon Tong or Mong Kok. However, apart from these places, I am sure that alternative venues in other region would be suitable.

This is the time for your suggestion! According to some discussion on Chinese Wikipedia, from August of 2007, the Hong Kong Wikimedians’ meet-up would be held in all districts of Hong Kong in a circulation basis.

Here is the tentative information of the first meet-up：
 Date：11, August, 2007 (Saturday) 
 Time：After 5:00pm
 Proposed region：Yuen Long

The community would request for ideas of where we should hold the meet-up , in order to have a better decision. If you have any good ideas, don’t hesitate to give your opinions, million thanks!

Regards,
Hong Kong Wikimedian

How can you discovery something the existence of which has already been established although those that proclaim it discovered were mistaken.

To say that gold was discovered in California in 1848 is an ethnocentric statement as well as an example of ignorance by those that either do not want to acknowledge that gold had already been verified as being in California therefore it cannot be a discovery.

 Tedious 

Look, this courtesy police thing is very tedious Your first warning was in the context of a pretty mild remark, where I happened to use the word """"disingenuous"""" in reference to someone's argument.  In this case, I'm sure I didn't respond particularly appropriately, but the whole thing is irritating.  It's particularly irritating to be informed of things by a bot.  And also irritating to get what are obviously public domain images deleted on the basis of this sourcing nonsense.  I haven't corrected it any further because PD Thor decided to reupload the same image and then orphan it, so I assume it will be deleted, so I'm not going to bother with fixing it, but really the whole thing is absurd.  I notice you say that the image's copyright status cannot be corroborated.  That is obvious nonsense.  PD Thor, the one who noticed its supposed """"unsourcedness"""", managed very easily to find a copy of the same map on the US government website and reupload it.  About two minutes of searching on the US Census website, I think, pretty much brings it up.  It is also identical to 49 or so other county maps present on wikipedia, most of which, I think, are sourced.  So, yeah, this is technically unsourced.  But a little common sense should tell anyone that it's obviously PD, and the right course should really be to find the source information oneself, rather than to threaten deletion and leave people to get obnoxious bot messages about it.  The whole way images are dealt with on Wikipedia is so byzantine and confusing as to be infuriating.  At any rate, any future messages from you on my talk page sternly warning me to be civil will be deleted without further comment.  I'm not interested in hearing from you about this subject, and your intervention does not make me feel particularly inclined to modify my conduct.  I will strive, as always, to avoid personal attacks.  I am sure that, on occasion, my emotions will get the better of me and I will screw up.  If you are concerned about such further instances, feel free to report me to the proper authorities, or what not.  I will add that I don't see how my role as an administrator is at all relevant here.  When I was promoted to administrator, at least, the idea of an administrator was basically someone who had been on wikipedia long enough that they were generally trusted to use the abilities of an administrator in a responsible fashion.  Whether or not I sometimes fly off the handle and use profanities, I am fairly certain that I have never abused my authority as an administrator, which I almost exclusively use to delete pages for moves.  I don't think I have ever inappropriately blocked a user or deleted a page.  There was at least one incident where I was accused of protecting a page inappropriately, but I think that was at least arguably justified.  So I feel like I'm pretty conscientious about my role as an administrator, and try hard not to abuse that power.  The idea that I have to be a model of ideal behavior in every other respect because of said status is a tenet that I do not hold.  Best,   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,train

Wikipedia is/was a fantastic resource that is now experiencing an exodus of wonderful contributors for a plethora of reasons and is having it's content distributed across the web for profit due to ridiculous policies. What made this project great was people challenging the norm and saying 'hey, this is how things are done, but lets try it this way...'. What's killing this project is good-meaning yet damaging editors following the rules and saying 'hey, this is how things are done'. I'm not a great editor, not even a very good one, I sort of stumbled my way through WP leaving a trail of destruction and fuck-ups as I went, but I always generally meant well and being reprimanded for reverting an obvious vandal epitomises what is wrong with WP now. I used to edit pretty heavily, especially vandal-fighting, but for the past six months or so haven't seen the point because, although the vandals are damaging, the policies and regular editors are down-right lethal. HJ Mitchel was, in my honest opinion, a cunt to do what he did (people can make up their own mind exactly what that was), I'm not saying he is a cunt of a person but as a WP editor/contributor/admin, possibly through no fault of his own but by the fault of the rules, policies and guidelines that he follows. I don't want people berating me for what I've just typed, or congratulating me, I've spent enough time on WP to know that people will be willing to do both (admittedly moreso in a more public forum) and even more will simply think their opinions the response to this rant will be so WP-standard I shan't even bother checking. talk to me """,0,0,0,0,0,0,train

CJ DUB Keeps Calling Users Ignorant - Violation of Wiki Rules
Hi, Deb. The user, CJ DUB continues to break Wiki rules by disrespecting others by insulting me. He stated the following, yet again: You are in fact ignorant. He also claims to be an editor """"with experience"""". A serious wiki editor with experience does not speak so ignorantly and disrespectfully about others. A wiki editor examines facts without judging others, as is the case in discriminatory environments. Therefore, he is not a wiki editor and is most likely a poser. He seems to be a sensitive american """"man"""" who feels everyone is against him or his american way of thinking. He must understand that not everyone will like him or his background. I have also noticed that another user named, Seb, may be the same person. He's probably using dual usernames in wiki. 
As a result of the above valid points, I urge blocking him for a long while so he learns to respect others on this forum. Again, he's broken wiki rules on respect for others 3 times. Thank you.

I think that it is important to mention national syndicalism at the beginning, as that eliminates a good amount of the problems with temporality associated with some of the more generalizing and overarching terms that have been suggested.
As for the left-right thing, it should be apparent that national syndicalism itself was a nationalistic movement, but the economics they embraced were not generally what would be considered """"right wing"""". I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements, but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff (i.e., totalitariansm, etc.), and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology. Neither of those is contradictory to the lead. Fascism arose during a fragmentary, transitional period, and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements. It's probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to """"national syndicalism"""" should facilitate, than oversimplify.
Regarding the deleted material, I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context (and sourcing). It should be borne in mind that the WWII-era fascist states of Italy and Germany along with the then quasi-fascist Japan formed the """"axis"""", for example, so the claim of xenophobia seems somewhat specious to me, though ethnocentrism sounds plausible. Just because it sounds plausible, however, does not mean that there are RS describing it as such. Militarism is a common thread, but how does monumental architecture relate to that? The sentence seems somewhat forced, so there has to be a concrete source connecting those in an intelligible manner. 連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0,0,0,0,0,0,train

Simply we will be assessing articles that have had the {WPBiography} template placed on their talk page but recieved no assessment. While doing that - what I suggest doing, and I try to make a habit of it as often as I can focus on it - is to help advance the article itself but tagging to be {expand}(ed) or if it contains no references to tag it for {references} and create a references section and adding the {reflist} template (so when references are added in the future they will automatically generate there). Being a part of a Wikipedia project helps to broaden your experience on Wikipedia while giving you a great insight to a lot of the policies, procedures, etc. Also, check out WP:AFD and peruse some of the discussion there to get an idea on how Articles for Deletion work or some of the WPPolicies and how they are implemented and adhered to.

 Reply to """"On gender"""" 

Your posted: Don't guess at someone's gender, as you have done here.  It is uncivil, and could in fact be taken as insult.  Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc.  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— dαlus Contribs 

If you know your friend’s gender, spit it out, you stupid ass. Your entire posting, if you didn’t have the agenda I ascribe to you, infra, would have been “FYI: He/she is a female/male” and I would adjust accordingly. Hell, if you tell me that Dayewalker is a consortium, and I’d refer to Dayewalker as “they/it.” Don’t continue to be an ass if you post further, or understand that your further postings are unworthy of reply.

I note that you are not correcting your friend Dayewalker when she posts to you 6 days ago """"I saw that afterwards, I knew HE was topic banned but it had slipped my mind about the overall bannation. Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010."""" Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to """"he’;"""" or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the """"he"""" is actually a """"she"""" and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the """"he"""" is too ballsy or pushy to be a woman/“lady.” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she.” Don't be an ass.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion. If you wish to join into the discussion, please feel free. On second thought, don’t join in. I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either. Dayewalker (he she, they, etc.) doesn’t answer his question. Ut oh, now I’ve called Chowbok a “he.” No doubt her boyfriend/girlfriend will rush in to call me a “beast” and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground. If Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a """"sissy"""" or a """"girlie,"""" then she can address that with me. He doesn't need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banned. And by """"protector,"""" I mean you. You are an ass. Male. Female. Both. Neither. And of whatever ‘sexual orientation,” if any, that you wish to use to identify yourself, or not identify yourself, or feel the need to identify yourself, or feel the need to keep private, or over which you do not care.

 If this is of any assistance 
Here is a copy of the list I last posted over at the Juggernaut Talk page of the small part of Asgardian's past offenses that I had the energy to look up when I originally wrote it. I have also asked User:Nightscream to contribute. Feel free to add anything that you may not have known previously:

Asgardian being a proven sockpuppet user, which turns suspicious whenever various anonymous ips have reverted to his edits: 

Asgardian's block page for consistent edit-warring, before starting to simply do one revert a day or so to get away with it, regardless if this is in direct violation of consensus, like in the Dormammu case:  

Newer conflicts:  

User: J Greb noticing that Asgardian has continually written edit-summaries that have little, or nothing to do with what he's actually doing, or even flat-out contradict it, and Asgardian stating that he'll continue to do so as long as he can get away with it:  """"I've grown very, very tired of edits like this where the editor does multiple things and then puts in a partially truthful edit summary."""" Response: """"As for J Greb's concern, I've made a request to be directed to the relevant rule on Wikipedia."""" 

User: Nightscream noticing Asgardian's tendency for dishonesty, to then accuse anyone who points if out for """"incivility"""", which given that he does what he always does makes it impossible to even respond: 

Asgardian recently apparently systematically vandalising page-structures just to make a point, and various other users making a plea to finally shut him down:    

Only the most recent situation of distorting profile content and deleting multiple references regardless that the information was entirely correct, and that the entire Talk population disagrees with him, and going by my experience on other pages such as Thanos he will eventually revert everything at a time when everyone else has mostly lost interest, even if he has to wait half a year to do so:  

(This proved prophetic, as most recently User:Duae_Quartunciae [warned] him of a ban if he continued to remove valid references, and he left the pages Dormammu alone for a few weeks after this, but then returned and did exactly the same thing all over again, despite that nobody agreed with him, with my main problem being that he essentially replaced referenced exact quotes with personal opinions.)

In addition, there was this old hint that he finds this behavior funny:  """"""""insidious misrepresentation""""...heh. How old are you?""""

That said, I have been reluctant to view him as a troll, since he does seem to try doing much more useful things than simply being a neverending nuisance for everyone in this """"community"""", myself in particular, despite , but reasoning and compromises (i.e. rewrite the sentences for better structure if you wish, but keep valid references and accuracy cor",0,0,0,0,0,0,train

It's definitely not a POV issue, it's a preference issue.  POV involves actual content issues where unverified and/or biased comments are made in the body of the article in relation to the subject (like saying """"Roosevelt High School is known for its strong academic programs"""" without any third-party sources to verfiy).  It would be one thing if I owned the kentschools.net domain and was pushing it to further my own viewpoint or product or kentschools.net was not an official school site, but neither is the case.  The difference between the two domain names is simply a matter of technical ownership, but not one of content or one being """"official"""" and one not.  Also, they are not redirects to each other.  For example, the popular website http://www.espn.com is actually a redirect to the real address.  If you type in www.espn.com (or click on the link), you will see the address in your browser change to http://espn.go.com.  If that were the case here, say kentschools.net redirected to kent.k12.oh.us, then yes, it would make sense to simply type in the actual address rather than the easier to remember one.

I was afraid that the section about his books rambled a bit, although I want to make sure to keep enough of it in. Especially in Szigeti on the Violin, he reveals a lot about his personal philosophy of music and violin playing, which (in my opinion)is very important for his biography. That said, I will try trimming it down.
Yes, he was indeed married to the same woman for all those years, and as far as I can tell their marriage was a very happy and harmonious one. There are some nice vignettes of their life together in his autobiography, maybe I'll try to work in a few mentions of domestic life somewhere.

It depends upon the type of explosion. It would be great to get articles for every notable R&B;/soul act, many of which are sorely lacking, and to get the ones on the notable ones up to a higher standard of coverage. But I would AfD, merge, and redirect overcoverage on any and all R&B;/soul artists or categories just like I'm doing now for pop articles. Case in point: """"Do You Know Where You're Going To"""" can easily be mentioned at Mahogany, without the need to create sepertate articles. Even though it was a number one hit, there's not enough information avaiable to write a full-fledged article on the song, and a stub repeats information already mentioned in the article for the movie. There is, and has to be, a cut-off as far as what gets included here, and what doesn't: something like a full Stevie Wonder discography, with an article for every single he's ever recorded, is far beyond the scope of the encyclopedia. As I've said before, most singles aren't notable outside of the fact that they are singles. Why make three articles on three singles that made no impact on society, culture, or otherwise; when they could be just as easily mentioned in an article for the song?

If someone writes an article for every Supremes single, most of them are going to get merged or AfD'd. THe same goes for any and every other act. Not even all of Michael Jackson's singles are notable enough for albums of their own. 

This isn't a bias or jelousy thing; could you please remove personal feelings and such from this, and thing about the encyclopedia as a whole, its standards, its level of writing, its established precedents, and exactly why this is even an issue?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,train

dec8a530c2ac5010,"NR post office 

Hello - I came across your query on the discussion page for the New Rochelle Post Office. If you want the correct information you cannot rely on what Orlady has told you. She is the sole individual objecting to the use of the term 'mural' when referring to the artwork that is in the building. The building is a NRHP however not so much for the architectural significance, but for the murals inside. Specific reference to the term 'mural' can be seen in a number of sources that were provided.  These sources include very reliable documents including: United States Post Offices in New York  1858 to 1943  Thematic Resources (the National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form), The Westchester County Planning Board discussing the post office in relation to re-developing the site,further discussions,  and the New York Times article about the artist selected to paint the murals. The nomination form is the most irrefutable source validating the information (it specifically references two of the three murals when discussing the importance of post office art). Additionally, the city of New Rochelle continues with redevelopment of the area and has recently come to the decision that the significance of the building itself is minimal, with its only true attribute being the 'distinctive curved contour' of the front facade which is familiar to residents of the area and should be maintained. (Im sorry but I cant find this specific document at the moment). The continuing reverting of this information is entirely the result of Orlady who personally does not seem to care for the facts. Unfortunately it is resulting in a deficient and inaccurate article. I also should mention that blocking users as alleged puppets of a banned user seems to be the most useful means for Orlady to control the content of certain articles. She is clearly abusing the tool. The validity of her claims is questionable at best. I was blocked as a result of my contributions to this article, and was labeled a 'sock'. Considering that I am in no way connected to the banned user, I found it rather disturbing to be blocked based on 'evidence' that has absolutely no validity whatsoever. Perhaps you can spend a moment to review the information provided and the facts will speak for themselves. Thank You",0,0,0,0,0,0,train

04a03779ac2f339d,"Tangential Forces 
 
The tangential forces (Coriolis and Euler) can be applied to a system but they don't occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism, but that is off topic.

During the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the Euler force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that I was confused between the two.

We can apply a Coriolis force or an Euler force to a system if we like. The Euler force will increase the angular acceleration and the Coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained co-rotating radial motion.

In a rotating frame of reference with non-uniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious Euler force acting tangentially.

In a Keplerian orbit, there will be zero tangential acceleration, although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite Euler force and Coriolis force.

Having said all this, tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article. They could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force. The centrifugal force is an outward radial force.

More attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the 'radial distance' variable.

They they might begin to get a feel for waht centrifugal force is all about.",0,0,0,0,0,0,train

db09449d3ca2efd2,"student uprising 1973 

I don't have any research data exactly, but I am an American who was a US Navy dependent wife living in Athens when the Polytechnic uprising occurred. And since I was there, although not directly involved in the uprising (just got caught in some of the crossfire) my perspective is quite different from what has been presented on the pages.  I would like to share with you what my experience was, and perhaps it could lead to some further illumination of what really happened during that month or 2. (It wasn't all over in 2-3 days, as the story indicates) And there were many more killed than the numbers listed, although I have no evidence of this. I personally saw beatings and shooting by police and army at the Polytechnic when I took a friend to deliver food to her brother who was a participant in the uprising. Her name was Litha and his was Vagellis. I no longer recall last names, but could probably find out from some old friends. She came to New York to attend college in the mid to late 1970s.

The question that has always haunted me is why the US government totally ignored the entire situation in spite of the fact that the 6th fleet was anchored at Elyfsis and the AirForce base was fully manned and operational. The American press did not even report the uprising. As I was only 21 at the time, my parents watched carefully for some news of what I had written to them once mail service was restored, and only a short virtually nondescript article from UPS showed up buried in the back pages of the newspapers. It was never even mentioned on television here.

I am still haunted by what I saw, and that was 32 years ago. I chose your user name from the discussion page because of the passion you wrote with in the wording of several of the sections (although they were changed from your original wording).

Pic
What does everyone think about moving the photo of him as Bond to the top? It's current, and it's a much better picture. Sure, the top one is more real, but it's a little too real. Like, just rolled out of bed, poured some beer on his cheerios and walked out to get the paper kind of real. When I brought this page up, I said, """"Yikes! That guy is uglier than Roger Moore!"""" The Bond pic does him justice, though.  
I'd rather leave it as is. Alternatively you could find a better image to replace the """"roll out of bed"""" picture.  
No problem, just figured I'd run it past you. I'm sure if there were any public domain photos of him out there that are more flattering, a better Bond fan than me would have found one by now. Happy editing!  
Someone needs to get the correct pictures back after some idiot decided to replace the pictures with pictures of woman. I fixed most of the references in the text though(they changed them to female as well i.e. actress/her).  16:12,  18 March 2006(UTC)
Done. I'm sure vandalism will increase the closer we get to the film being released. Just beware.. 

Born during the Bond film series
I know that Craig was born the year after the release of You Only Live Twice and the year before On Her Majesty's Secret Service, am I right? I just put down """"a year before On Her Majesty's Secret Service."""" He was born in the Sean Connery era right, not George Lazenby?
It's correct, but I wouldn't say Lazenby had an era at all.  
I would say Sean Connery era because he returned in Diamonds are Forever in 1971 after Lazenby in OHMSS. Lazenby did not have an era. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) .

Introduction to US audiences
I don't know if it's correct to say that the Lara Croft film introduced him to American audiences. I remember hearing some buzz about him in Elizabeth which while it didn't do Lara Croft-level box office, was still a substantial success in North America. Thoughts?  

I hadn't heard about that, but it's no big deal to me either way. I made the change because the text as it stood made it seem that Road to Perdition was his first introduction to US audiences, which on the evidence of Tomb Raider was manifestly untrue. If there is clear evidence of Elizabeth'''s priority, I have no problem with that.  
I'm not familiar enough with Elizabeth to be certain. I do know it was listed as one of his career highlights more often than Tomb Raider when he was announced as Bond; the only time I saw Tomb Raider connected to him in the media was when it was rumored Angelina Jolie was up for the role of Vesper.  

While it's probably the better film — and was even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar — from memory his role in Elizabeth is a relatively minor one. Certainly he wasn't one of the main stars (who were pretty much Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes and Craig's Our Friends in the North'' co-star Christopher Eccleston).

Are you being facetious? if not, you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres. If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide. You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.

The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same """"tag team"""" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.

It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under """"UK mediation"""" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS.

 The McIntosh et al. 2013 study on rotational acceleration and bicycle helmets 

I have restored the reference to this study in the """"Rotational Injury"""" section of the article - someone had removed it and substituted a reference to a another study by McIntosh et al. which deals only with motorcycle helmets. Unfortunately, it seems the publisher has made a mistake and the McIntosh et al. paper and one other paper are missing from the online journal contents (you can see the gap in the page numbers for that issue). The corresponding author is endeavouring to have that corrected, but the paper does exist, I have seen a copy of it. It isn't indexed in PubMed yet either.  In the meantime, I will post of a copy of the abstract from the paper here:
ANDREW S. MCINTOSH, ADRIAN LAI and EDGAR SCHILTER. Bicycle Helmets: Head Impact Dynamics in Helmeted and Unhelmeted Oblique Impact Tests. Traffic Injury Prevention (2013) 14, 501–508. online DOI: 10.1080/15389588.2012.727217. 
Objective: To assess the factors, including helmet use, that contribute to head linear and angular acceleration in bicycle crash simulation tests.
Method: A series of laboratory tests was undertaken using an oblique impact rig. The impact rig included a drop assembly with a Hybrid III head and neck. The head struck a horizontally moving striker plate. Head linear and angular acceleration and striker plate force were measured. The Head Injury Criterion was derived. The following test parameters were varied: drop height to a maximum of 1.5 m, horizontal speed to a maximum of 25 km/h, helmet/no helmet, impact orientation/location, and restraint adjustment. Additional radial impacts were conducted on the same helmet models for comparison purposes. Descriptive statistics were derived and multiple regression was applied to examine the role of each parameter. 
Results: Helmet use was the most significant factor in reducing the magnitude of all outcome variables. Linear acceleration and the Head Injury Criterion were influenced by the drop height, whereas angular acceleration tended to be influenced by the horizontal speed and impact orientation/location. The restraint adjustment influenced the outcome variables, with lower coefficients of variation observed with the tight restraint. 
Conclusions: The study reinforces the benefits of wearing a bicycle helmet in a crash. The study also demonstrates that helmets do not increase angular head acceleration. The study assists in establishing the need for an agreed-upon international oblique helmet test as well as the boundary conditions for oblique helmet testing.

I'm also considering adding a part that would describe a steady-state solution with a driving voltage. My biggest worry is that this article will end up being very incongruous, but I think it's preferable so long as the first part is as transparent as possible.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,train

 Response to the vandals (daughters of Sonja de Lennart) 

While Wikipedia administrator SWATJester is protecting you, your hoax has been thoroughly exposed.  Your mother was not a famous designer and did not create Capri pants.   

Your """"Professor Mueller"""" is a phony source.  He is neither a professor nor affiliated with the University of Zurich.  

Your only """"evidence"""" for your mother being a designer comes from the claims you made, on the website one of you created last year and owns, with completely unverifiable pictures.

Your insistence that Emilio Pucci would have been upset at Edith Head receiving an Oscar for his work makes no sense, except as an attempt to deceive readers.  The Academy Award for Best Costumes goes to a person chosen by the movie studio to create the wardrobes for the film.  Emilio Pucci was not creating costumes for a film, and would have had no reason to complain that someone else received an Oscar for what was not his effort.  Nor would Hubert de Givenchy have felt a need to give Emilio Pucci credit for the creation of Capri pants.  Emilio Pucci did no work on Sabrina.

You can't even keep your lies straight - in one post you claim that she was widely interviewed by fashion magazines and in another you claim that she did not know how to handle the international press.

Apparently, in your twisted mind, it was not prevalent in Europe to place information in books or magazines either.  

You have instigated a fraud, for the purpose of selling your books - claiming to be the daughters of a famous designer will get you appearances on TV and radio shows to hawk your books.  Since your publisher appears to be a vanity publishing house primarily devoted to the two of you, every bit of publicity must help.

You have not in any way substantaited your 'bias' rants. You've merely thrown mud and ducked when asked why.

I see you have amended the wording so as to lose the distinctive phrase I objected to; thank you for that. However the source does not support the assertion you are now making - it says nothing about """"learning how to earning a living by gardening."""" And so I'll remove the sentence once again. If you can get something that is a) not plagiarism and b) supported by the source, then the problem will be over.

The Tadias site looks fine and is reasonably reliable as support that she was stripped of her title. It would be good to add a couple of other independent news sources though.

The fact that she lost her title: I guess it seems reasonably backed up (Tadias site) and can be used in the article. However, I don't see why it needs to be said again and again. The story is straightforward and doesn't require a lot of words. She was the Miss Ethiopia World for 2003. She was stripped of the title by the Ethiopian Life Foundation when she stayed back in the Philippines after participating in the Nov 2003 Miss Earth contest. End of story.

 Please delete user/disc pages; warn jayron/redpen/mufka 
Hello stephen,
If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.

I requested speedy deletion on 1Apr for reason 1.6. jayron deleted it, then acted  as if s/he did me a favour. I feel jayron shouldnt have been the one to delete it initially as s/he  and I have negatively interacted in the past. Followups from jayron included an unneccesary block; followed by telling me to get a yahoo email so that I may contact wiki admins! 

Wiki is all about anon editing  as such I didnt and wont get an email account in order to communicate as it is not required.

Since then jayron,redpen, mufka have been repeatedly editing my page. I blank my page they restore it. This has been happening since April, so for 3months now.  I bet if I changed their pages they'd posting threats of  """"i'll report you"""" and/or """"you will be banned"""". It is quite easy for me to get a new ip address but I dont think Ive done anything wrong, so  I wont change my ip address. 

If my pages needed to be restored /reverted, I definitely think those three arent the ones who should do it as they/I have  a convoluted history.

If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.
If you could contact jayron, redpen, & mufka & ask that any problems they have they let an admin or arbitrator know, instread of making changes or posting to me.

This RS question is whether Stephen Hill, the cofounder of a notable niche music genre, """"spacemusic"""", can be disqualified as a secondary source expert, and have his radio production company's website (= expert's book) reclassified with primary source usage restrictions (results in removal). 

The radio production company is Hearts of Space established 25 years ago (35 including the original Music From the Hearts of Space show on KPFA). HoS was historically played on more than 250 USA public radio stations on a scale of 500. This 2004-01-11 San Francisco Chronicle description of Stephen Hill's expertise reads: 
""""Hill, who coined the term """"spacemusic"""" more than 20 years ago, hosts the """"Music From the Hearts of Space"""" music program, syndicated on 250 National Public Radio stations, including San Francisco's KALW 91.7 FM, which airs two hours of the program at 10 p.m. Sundays. In addition, Hill's Hearts of Space Web site (www.hos.com) provides streaming access to an archive of hundreds of hours of spacemusic artfully blended into one-hour programs combining ambient, electronic, world, New Age and classical music.""""

The claim as I understand it (maybe I don't), is that a justified primary source reclassification, along with other sources properly reclassified as primary, would cause a synthesis/OR violation in the article titled Space music. The further result would be that the cofounder's detailed analysis, opinions, and other website information would be mostly removed from the article about the genre he cofounded. 

The campaigning editor says his most contentious objection is that the name of the genre is a """"commercial entity's branding drive"""". Presumably, he objects strongly to a previously unnoticed form of commercial spam in the Wikipedia article, and a great wrong should be righted by minimizing it. If I correctly understand it, I can only describe this position as extremist. 

Spacemusic genre is a case of limited circle fame. Its current USA public radio fans are thinly scattered, but dedicated to its support through public radio fund drives. Its niche music sales amount to less than 1% of the commercial market, so very little is written about spacemusic in major USA music publications dependent on commercial advertising. 

(The rest of the 102 Space music sources to be considered for reclassification as primary, and then removed for synthesis/OR, should be handled separately to avoid noticeboard overload.) 
 

 I suppose all this would give some reason for caution in using these sources, and particularly a reason to be careful to try to double-source things and to give all sides where sources disagree, but it sounds to me like Hill would be a perfectly reasonable source. Where he is writing about his own work in fostering the genre, or about his own show, he's primary. Where he's writing about the musicians in the genre, it would seem to me that he is secondary, just like any music critic. -  | Talk 

I agree with  on all three points - multiple sources are always recommended when there are differing published views on a topic.  On the primary/secondary question - Hill would be a primary source when writing about himself and his own radio show. On third-party topics such as music styles, record albums, musicians, the radio and music business, etc, he'd be a secondary source.   I'd say that within his area of expertise, there's no reason not to use his work as a reliable source.   

Just to be clear about the encyclopedia-margins deletionist effect of what you are both saying: 

Stephen Hill and his Hearts of Space website were previously treated as expert-based secondary sources via WP:V(WP:SPS). The Wikipedia art/music reasoning has previously been that the founder of an art/music genre knows subjectively more about what he/she created than anyone else as a matter of expert opinion. You are changing that.

What a secondary source says can be combined in a point-by-point source-provable editorial analysis. In this case, since there are so few other mainstream sources, many or most of them are presently combined with Hill's previous secondary source expertise to write the article.

But a primary source has fewer rights in an article than a secondary source. What a primary source says cannot be combined with other sources for a standard article editorial analysis, even if every point made by article editors can be proved through analysis of t",0,0,0,0,0,0,train

 Weedpatch Camp 

Thanks for creating the article.

Discography
We should be able to come up with a definitive list of commercially released albums and singles. Let's start with the headings. 

Officially Released
Self Released
Singles
Out of Print Compilations
In Print Compilations

Those should be in sentence case. Do folks agree on those headings? - 

 I think those sound reasonable. I have changed them to sentence case, and re-added the record covers which were deleted from the discography by Jonah. I also re added the descriptions of Rose's musical style that were deleted without explanation. Finally I re-incorporated a new version of the sentence dealing with racism and antisemitism. It makes not direct claims about Rose's online work, only that it deals with race and religion. Then I wrote that this has created a series of accusations of racism and antisemitism in various online chat groups. While online chat groups are not officially a source, the fact remains that these criticisms are out there, posted in various places. I think that this should satisfy both SP (by being NPOV) and Ayers (by bringing up the issue).  Hope this helps. I agree with Will, let's move on.  

I do wonder at the designations of """"self-released"""" vs. """"officially released."""" At what point does one become the other? """"Bone Again"""" and """"Elizabethan Period"""" were funded by people or companies other than Biff, and given professional print runs of a few to several thousand; they were distributed through non-internet indie channels, and reviewed in Mojo magazine.  """"Roast Beef"""" was pressed using Biff's royalties, but then it was picked up by a distributor who slapped their own record label's sticker on the cover; several thousand were produced and sold.  """"Hamburger Blues"""" was an """"official"""" release that may have been a smaller print run than some of Biff's website releases.  """"Uncle Jesus"""" was a major label album that is harder to find than """"Roast Beef."""" """"The Pickwick album was an """"offical"""" compilation of far seedier origin than some of the indie releases.  The whole issue of """"in print"""" vs. """"out of print"""" is a bit difficult to assess as well.  If copies are sealed, stockpiled and available, isn't the album still """"in print""""?

My concern with these categories is that they tend to appear at the same times that text changes are made diminishing Biff's accomplishments; and they seem to be included as part of the intent of that effort.  If you look at other artists' discographies, these distinctions are rarely made.  For example, see Sun_Ra.  A great many of Sun Ra's albums were self-released, including most of the artistic milestones.  It is a vague and misleading designation.  Why not go for straight chronology?

And to confirm Marcuse's interpretation, I was not implying that Marcuse initiated a given edit.  Is someone trying to start fights where they ain't?   

The problem here is that you wrote something, a line that went unsingned, but on closer inspection was found to be added by you but attributed by you to someone esle. You then followed this by saying that you agreed with the line. Very unwiki of you.

Indeed, someone is trying to start fights where they ain't.   

 Wallawe/Jonah, I'm curious what the """"released on cdr"""" that you keep adding to the discography means? What is cdr? As far as the self vs. officially why don't we just simply put """"Full length releases"""" and combine them?  

In most of these cases """"cdr"""" is not an accurate designation.  Some of them were glass-mastered CDs.  But as I said above, I don't think that's too important, anyway.  

, you claimed to revert back to Marcuse, but you did not.  That's a super-misleading tag.  

And now I understand what you are referring to:  .  That's something I do a lot.  It's called """"Paragraphs.""""  Here, I'll do one right now.  Here goes....

The first paragraph was one sentence long and  went: """"Judiasm is targeted"""" is a really problematic phrase.

 Where does the term 'Canoe River' come from?
 I would have liked to know more technical details about the accident; for instance, what type of rolling stock was being used? Of course, if no such information is available...
 The quote regarding the bar examination, is that just an example, or is that the whole examination?
 To me, the whole trial section is POV; I get the impression that the article has taken side with the defense in the case. In part this is because the article goes quite in detail with the defense' arguments, but lacks a similar listing of the crowns'.

I would counter your argument by saying that as it pertains to this issue, which hospital he was born in is not a """"minor factoid"""". Especially considering that the location of his birth has been disputed and that it may affect his eligibility to be President. A little more looking into the matter reveals to me that the possible basis for the claim that he was born at that particular hospital is a statement by his sister in 2008 claiming such, and nothing else (at least that I can find). Do you find it an unreasonable stretch to suggest that his sister might be incorrect and that further verification would be reasonable?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,train

what context does """"enlargement of government power"""" belong here?
It does not belong. Progressives do not wish to enlarge government power for the sake of enlarging government power. Progressives believe that modern society needs government intervention to ensure fair play, e.g. government regulation, and to protect the citizens, e.g. universal health care. Beck believes these are fringe views, but I do not. TFD seems to believe that believing in Progressive values is fringe, but he would be on Beck's side with side with that.
""""You have taken the quote out of context and the source is a high school textbook,""""
It is from Brittanica, and here is the full quote:
Origins of progressivism
Never were superficial signs more deceiving. Actually, the United States already was in the first stages of what historians came to call the Progressive movement. Generally speaking, progressivism was the response of various groups to problems raised by the rapid industrialization and urbanization that followed the Civil War. These problems included the spread of slums and poverty; the exploitation of labour; the breakdown of democratic government in the cities and states caused by the emergence of political organizations, or machines, allied with business interests; and a rapid movement toward financial and industrial concentration. Many Americans feared that their historic traditions of responsible democratic government and free economic opportunity for all were being destroyed by gigantic combinations of economic and political power.

Actually there was not, either in the 1890s or later, any single Progressive movement. The numerous movements for reform on the local, state, and national levels were too diverse, and sometimes too mutually antagonistic, ever to coalesce into a national crusade. But they were generally motivated by common assumptions and goals—e.g., the repudiation of individualism and laissez-faire, concern for the underprivileged and downtrodden, the control of government by the rank and file, and the enlargement of governmental power in order to bring industry and finance under a measure of popular control.
This is very non-ambiguous
This is an article from Center for American Progress the biggest Progressive group in America, and in it it describes in detail the origins of the progressive movement and it's continuance today.
""""What is progressivism?
Progressivism at its core is grounded in the idea of progress—moving beyond the status quo to more equal and just social conditions consistent with original American democratic principles such as freedom, equality, and the common good. Progressivism as an  intellectual movement emerged between 1890 and 1920 as a response to the multitude of problems associated with the industrialization of the U.S. economy—frequent economic depressions, political corruption, rising poverty, low wages, poor working conditions, tenement living, child labor, lack of collective bargaining power, unsafe consumer products, and the misuse of natural resources.
""""As a philosophical tradition, progressivism in its most complete form developed as a “new liberalism” for a new century—updating the American liberal tradition from its Jeffersonian, small-government, republican roots best suited for the agrarian economy of the nation’s founding era to a more democratic and modern liberalism capable of checking rising corporate power. The original progressives argued that changes in the economy’s organization required a more complete understanding of human freedom, equality, and opportunity that Jefferson championed so persuasively. Progressives believed that formal legal freedom alone—the negative protections against government intrusions on personal liberty—were not enough to provide the effective freedom necessary for citizens to fulfill their human potential in an age of rising inequality, paltry wages, and labor abuses. Changed conditions demanded a changed defense of human liberty.""""
With the rise of the contemporary progressive movement and the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, there is extensive public interest in better understanding the origins, values, and intellectual strands of progressivism. Who were the original progressive thinkers and activists? Where did their ideas come from and what motivated their beliefs and actions? What were their main goals for society and government? How did their ideas influence or diverge from alternative social doctrines? How do their ideas and beliefs relate to contemporary progressivism?

Perhaps easiest is to imagine an airfoil propagating through a large """"body of air"""" which is initially at rest. Once the airfoil is well inside this body of air (by several chord lengths, say 5 or more), the rate of vertical momentum change of this body of air is equal to the lift. Or more precise: the reaction force of the wing on the air (minus the lift force). At the edges of this body of air, far from the airfoil, nothing is happening. 

Small air parcels are subject to three laws:
 mass conservation: the mass of a parcel is constant. Its position, volume and shape may change. 
 Newton's laws: the 2nd law states that the rate of change of momentum is equal to the net force on the parcel. The 3rd law states that the force by one parcel on its neighbour is equal to minus the force by that neighbour on that particular parcel.
 A force model: if incompressible flow is assumed, the pressure distribution at the edge of the parcel is such that its volume does not change (but its position and shape may change). In case of a compressible fluid, pressure and volume are related through some thermodynamic equation of state (since the parcel mass is constant, a volume change implies a density change) . 
These three act together. In general the influence of the airfoil diminished with the distance from it, since the effect of the displaced volume by the moving airfoil is largest in its neighbourhood. Hope this gives some clues to pinpoint where the crux of your problem is.    21:57""",0,0,0,0,0,0,train

 Reply to Brews ohare 

Brews, I am fully aware of the difference between kinematics and kinetics. This aticle doesn't need to involve that difference.

You quoted above an expression for acceleration. That expression is correct. I am not disagreeing with it. But it tells us absolutely nothing that would enable us to solve a motion problem.

To solve a problem in motion, we need an input force. If it only kinematics, we still need an input acceleration.

We always need some kinds of contraints or known accelerations before we can determine a trajectory.

Excellent points about some of the other very important events in history! Reportedly, Columbus kidnapped a handful of natives and brought them back to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. Whether or not he was abusive toward them aboard ship remains undecided. Some say he was kind to them (according to his journal!) while others say differently. At any rate, with the order of Isabella and Ferdinand, the thousands upon thousands of Spanish Conquistadors who invaded America, and Columbus, himself, did basically cause the destruction of many of the New World Mongoloids (whose ancestors had crossed the land bridge from Asia to America many centuries before). How strange is Mankind? Two centuries before Columbus, the Mongoloids were responsible for the destruction of many Europeans (especially Eastern Europeans) during the Mongol Empire. Later, it would be the Europeans causing the destruction of many of the New Word Mongoloids in America. It's like Ghengis Khan = Christopher Columbus (with a special nod to Isabella and Ferdinand).

The first two sources for the """"Legacy"""" section are explaining the situation where Jack Welch in 2012 tweeted an implication that the Labor Department could be fixing job numbers. He had a lot of criticism and also attention from the Obama campaign, but told WSJ that he should have used a question mark in the original tweet because he wanted to raise a question about the legitimacy of the job numbers. He states in his own words that the debate has led to people looking at unemployment data more carefully and skeptically. Quote: “The coming election is too important to be decided on a number. Especially when that number seems so wrong.” 

The NYT source talks about the future of GE as it “gets past the Jack Welch Era” and the fate of GE Capital enterprise as a spin-off many years after Welch has left.

The current article mentions very little about the Jack Welch Management Institute, but the WiredAcademic article provides a direct interview with Jack Welch where he discusses the school and his view on digital learning. The article provides a lot of details about the Institue as well as his opinions.

She may well have a 5-octave range, but singers are defined by their *effective* range, not merely the pitch boundaries of their natural range (including the falsetto). However, Carey is a phenomenal singer regardless of her full range. Hell, I have a range of over three octaves, but I'm only effective in slightly under two, i.e. I can really only sing in my effective range. I can *reach* the outer limits of the larger range but I can't sustain pitch accuracy or handle any considerable length of melody. Again, regardless of her range, she's proved many times over that she is effective in most of her range. Vision Of Love remains one of the most remarkable vocal performances I've ever heard. I'd love to hear her sing some of Hildegard von Bingen's music, she's probably the only popular singer who could actually do it with ease. Btw, Billie Holiday was one of the greatest singers yet her full range not broad - some say only about an octave and a half - and she packs more meaning and soul into her renditions than most better-endowed voices. Range is no determinate of anything but boundary conditions, the real news is what gets done within the given range, of course. Again, I think MC is simply phenomenal in that regard. Oh, one word more re: range and I'm gone: Captain Beefheart is also said to have had an enormous vocal range. I love his music too, but he was no MC. )

This article (in its current state) is weird. It looks like someone pushing an issue or their own advice or something. I can't explain it. Looks a little bit like an essay on agriculture in general. But the only information i think we need to keep from it which regards agricultural productivity is:

for economists: agricultural productivity is measuring production of an agricultural good + estimating its value on the market, which = an indication of its profit-making potential.

for farmers: the term agricultural productivity means first the ability (for themselves or their community) to survive on the agricultural goods they produce. [perhaps list here the agricultural products mentioned in the article which the community can use, e.g. food (crops, dairy & meat), hides, manure, etc]

the part about it being a better idea to produce a variety of products instead of just specialising in one product (eg crops) is interesting information, but i'm not sure it belongs here. Any ideas on how to incorporate it into this article, or perhaps another one?",0,0,0,0,0,0,train

913420fe2f66726a,""":""""Emo has a specific meaning, like banana, not an all-inclusive one, like fruit.""""  I could not possibly disagree more.

It's impossible to split the """"historical"""" and """"popular"""" notions of emo because they're the same thing.

Since my """"grunge"""" example failed, here's another: """"Hip hop"""".  In the 80s, """"hip hop"""" described dance-influenced music that featured light-hearted lyrics, as performed by groups like Digital Undergound and DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince.  In the 90s, """"hip hop"""" described Gangsta Rap, as performed by Snoop, Dr Dre, and 2Pac.  In the 00s, """"hip hop"""" described an R&B-influenced; almalgamation of the two, as performed by Nelly and 50 Cent.

Your arguments that the original emo is the only emo is like claiming that Nelly and 50 Cent aren't """"hip hop"""" because their music sounds little to nothing like the 80s version of """"hip hop"""".  Instead, """"hip hop"""" of 2005 should be remembered for some NYC underground band whose sound is reminiscent of 80s hip hop.

Here's the key: ask someone in twenty years what """"emo"""" was like in 2005, what bands would you honestly expect them to throw out?  Indie bands that few people have heard of, or popular bands like Coheed and Cambria?

Splitting the scenes into """"waves"""" is a perfectly acceptable way to reflect the popularity of """"emo"""" over the years.  If you were to ask a random person what emo was in the 80s, they'd probably say Rites of Spring.  Ask a random person what emo was in the 90s, they'd probably say Sunny Day Real Estate or Jimmy Eat World.  (Don't disagree with this point simply because you would think of someone else first.)

Journalists and record labels didn't decide that the second wave of emo was emo.  Fans of the music did.  Regardless of how you feel about it, that's what happened.  It's historical and 100% true.

No matter who deemed modern emo to be emo, fans have accepted it.  End of story.

Encyclopedic articles (and Wiki articles, according to THE OFFICIAL GUIDELINES) are supposed to reflect the historical record shared by the most people.  Only a modest handful of people have heard of bands like Hot Cross and Trophy Scars, no matter how much you wish otherwise.

It's perfectly acceptable to include references to bands that still practice original emo.  That's a worthy part of the historical record.  However, your insistence that modern emo is illegitimate and should not be covered in the same article is a minority POV, which the Wiki rules are explicitly against.

Seriously, don't get me wrong: I'm entirely frustrated that """"emo"""" means something else now than it did ten years ago.  Every time I mention to people that I was in an emo band in the late 90s, I basically have to defend myself and go into some long-winded explanation that's completely meaningless to them.  BUT THAT'S LIFE.  That's how things are now, and how the word """"emo"""" has shifted in the last twenty years.  They know """"emo"""" to be something completely different from what it was, and I have to live with that.

And so does everyone else working on this article.  ChrisB

 Developer access

I thought it wise to diversity the group by including some Wikipedians who have different perspectives, like Fred and Martin, and some who are longtime contributors but tend to stay out of Wikipolitics altogether, like JohnOwens and the Anome.

By the way, if you're serious about limiting the number of developers, you may wish to prune the list to exclude people who were once very active but are no longer involved.  It isn't healthy (or secure) to include a bunch of emeriti on such lists.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk)

In addition to a pretermination (Loudermill) hearing, an employee must be afforded a full evidentiary hearing, after the termination takes effect.[2] However, the scope of the pretermination hearing depends upon the scope of the post-termination hearing available to the employee. If a full post-termination hearing is available, the Loudermill pretermination hearing is minimal.

In such situations the employee would have an opportunity to respond in the pretermination hearing as long as she had available a post-termination hearing. Thus, the pre-termination hearing functions as """"an initial check against mistaken decision  essentially a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.""""[3] If a pretermination hearing is """"oral or written notice of the charges against [the employee], an explanation of the employer's evidence [against the employee], and an opportunity [for the employee] to present their side of the story.""""[4]

The final sentence makes no sense, as it is not a complete sentence. The first paragraph also makes little sense, because it says that an employee MUST be afforded a full, post-termination hearing, but then goes on to say that if a full post-termination hearing is available, the pre-termination hearing is minimal.

This needed to be clarified since there has been a problem with him inserting subsequent posts ahead of mine, which can be misleading to a reader. When I tried to correct the positions yesterday in another incident, here is what he wrote in his edit summary when he positioned his post ahead of mine again:

01:57, 13 May 2010 The Magnificent Clean-keeper (talk | contribs) m (180,836 bytes) (Undid revision 361800511 by Zlykinskyja (talk)Don't fucking move my comments again. This is plain vandalism) (undo)

So when I objected to his use again of the word """"fucking"""" he then used it at me two more times, as reflected above. This follows a prior incident a few weeks ago when he used the word """"fucking"""" at me. I repeatedly objected and asked him not to do that. I think he did this again because he knew it would upset me because of how upset I was about the prior incident. 

Also, I have been called by someone else a """"bitch"""" and the words """"cunt"""" and """"cock"""" """"shit"""" have been directed at me on this Talk page. I have repeatedly objected and nothing is done. It is as if women who want to contribute here have to put up with a gauntlet of abuse if they wish to stay here. And no, it isn't unreasonable to object to such disrespectful treatment of women. This is not the 1950s. None of this should be going on.   """,0,0,1,0,0,0,train

The COI tag, like most others, is a form of clean up notification. It's supposed to indicate that an article was authored by, or underwent a major edit by a conflicting party to other editors, who may then neutralise the content. It is not supposed to have full-time residence on the article once clean up has been performed and the editor/s with any COI cease to disruptively affect the neutrality of the article (which should really be brought to admin attention, not via a tag). Keeping it once the article has been made neutral is misleading and also makes Wiki articles """"ugly"""". There are thousands of articles on Wiki where the original author was closely-related to the content. Once an uninvolved editor steps in and makes the tone/content neutral the tag is no longer valid. Its purpose is to serve as a warning that the content may not be neutral to other editors. Given than a lot of editors have since taken control of the matter here, and are enforcing measures to prevent Dom and those closely related to Davina from introducing puffery, peacocking and any other bollocks, there isn't really any need to """"warn"""" anyone that the content may be untrue. I'm sure if or when Davina's meatpuppet """"fans"""" make edits they are quickly spotted, verified and removed if unsupported. As such, I recommend removing the tag, in due course, once the minor disputes are settled. Tags are aids for editors to develop the article as fore mentioned, they should not be used in the spirit of a warning system to general readers.  [Chat • RFF] """,0,0,0,0,0,0,train

  Excuse me, Logolist, but there's no purpose served by implying obliquely that the Germans of today have designs upon Wroclaw, Szczecin, Gdansk, etc., if that's what you intended above.

Beyond that, you should understand that all these points of view about ex-German places that are part of post-1945 Poland have been made, aired, discussed, contested and reiterated ad nauseum on Wiki during the past couple of years.

My own view is that these places were known to most of the world by their German names for a long time, which should be explained where RELEVANT, i.e. in any historical section. This is especially true of Danzig/Gdansk, given its unique history in the interwar period and internationally high profile politically. A secondary point is that these places where known to their INHABITANTS by their German names before 1945.

There's nothing revanchist or revisionist in naming places with the names by which they were known to the world and to themselves during the historical periods involved. Indeed, it is linguistically revisionist, in a sense, to refer to Danzig (for example) as Gdansk when writing about the six centuries in which it was inhabited mainly by Germans.

I've argued all along that the Germans today should refer to these places by their Polish names when referring to contemporary events – for the same reasons that they should be referred to by their German names when historical events are the issue.

on the Creator
The demiurge is an expression of philosophy, in that it is a Greek or Hellenistic cultural concept. This means that the Demiurge is a cultural concept from the Greeks who did not believe in the empirical existence of nothingness as non-substantive (ex-nihilo). They treated nothingness as a substance called aether. The Greeks as pagans and pagan philosophers did not believe that you can get nothing from something therefore the creator had to create from """"something"""". Plato it was the good, Aristotle it was energy, Plotinus it was force. These are ontological noema that create consciousness in humans. This arises from the unique essence of Greek or Hellenistic philsophy treating the natural (physic) and supernatural (metaphysic) as extensions of human consciousness. So everything that can be talked about or experienced stems from human consciousness and therefore must be expressed from a anthropomorphic perspective. God or Gods can not be anything outside of human. That's why Zeus and the Gods are flawed as their flaws reflect in man and mankinds flaws reflect in them. The demiurge as a phrase is creator and nothing can be created but in the way that mankind creates. The Greek Orthodox Christian God is not relatiable to the Actus et potentia as the Roman Catholic God since, God in essence is not action or inaction or potential nor inpotential this would make God's being, essence or substance comprehenisible and that then is not the Ortohodox Christian God. The Christian God is not one (the monad) or unity according to St Dionysus the Areopagite.   
Orthodox Christianity did not have the same God therefore the """"concept of God"""" uses and has familiar language (between Hellenstic Greek and Byzantine Greek) but in essence, substance is a different concept of God. In Greek Orthodox Christianity (which Iamblichus kinda tried to graft into Neoplatonism after the fact) God is in and outside the Universe. God is made up of a substance that is beyond substance since God's consciousness ontologically is hyper-being. Meaning that God as a substance can not be detected nor contained. Now this was dependent on the concept of hypostasis, immanence or existence (cataphatic). The Pagan philosophical God was a detectable substance that all things derive from and reduced to. The Orthodox Christian God is a hyper substance that is not empirically detectable. Mankind has to be altered in order to detect it. Since the God in Greek Orthodox Christianity in his trinitarian completeness (uncreatedness) does not have the same consciousness as mankind, did not share mankinds consciousness until he became a human being AKA Jesus Christ. The reverse is only true in Philosophy since in Orthodox Christianity God as a whole has a consciousness which is completely unrelatable to mankind. Philosophy God and mankind have the same consciousness and Roman Catholicism and Protestantism treat God ontologically very much as modalistic (like Sabellianism) which creates also a different consciousness. Orthodox Christianity also rejects this as anthropomorphic-izing the Christian God, which can only come from not actually having experiencing the Christian God (theoria) and only experiencing the template in your brain or intrinsic God of philosophy.

 Negative capability as a social theory 

Negative capability is more fully articulated as a social theory by Roberto Unger in his work on false necessity. It differs slightly from Keats in that he uses it to describe the individual's challenge to an existing social order and the capacity to collapse the distance between a context-preserving routine and a context-transforming challenge. In this way it is less about uncertainty and more about a state of empowering resistance, albeit not necessarily within a stable institutional space. 

I am prepared to add Unger's use of negative capability to this entry, but not sure how to integrate it to what is already here. On the one hand it is much more developed than anything Keats produced, but also done so in a different context. In this manner, relegating Keats to background section of the entry might not work (nor would it really do justice to the legacy of poetry and English litalthough this part of the entry needs to be developed more). So, any suggestions/ideas on how to integrate? Or should we create two separate entries, e.g. """"Negative capacity (poetry)"""" and """"Negative capacity (philosophy/social theory)""""?

 Crown of Ptolemy 

Hi there Methychroma. I just went and briefly looked over your draft of the """"Crown of Ptolemy"""" article WP:PJTF has been working towards, and since there's such a large backlog on articles for review, I wanted to give you some advice so it passes quickly and easily on the first try.
You might want to remove the second """"references"""" section.
If you can find any other references and double-check that all your references meet  Wikipedia's citation guidelines, that would be really great. Citing the short story itself could also be good;  Easy Bib could help if you don't actually own a copy.
The category """"2015 short stories"""" does not exist; it could be an idea to remove that category from the draft (very minor though). Also make sure the page is categorized somehow under Rick Riordan. Check out [Category:Rick Riordan] to see how similar articles have been done.
See if you can get the plot section shortened at all, and made more general so outsiders who do not know the series can understand it more easily.
Put more wikilinks in the plot section  and make sure the page is well-linked to pages like The Kane Chronicles#Main characters and applicable Percy Jackson pages.
See if you can get a picture of the """"cover"""" uploaded and put into the article.
There may also be a Rick Riordan interview or some such that could provide you with info to make a section about the story's production or some online reviews for reception. Try Kirkus, Common Sense Media, and  here. This is actually the most important suggestion I have, because the notability that comes from a novel's real-world reception is most important for an article under review.

I'm sure you've already done most of these things, but I just wanted to help you catch anything you did miss. Good luck, and in case I forgot to say, it looks really great!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,train

 Articles for deletion/Fruit (slang) 

Copy deemed personal attack and removed from discussion page:  I believe that LtPowers was coerced into making his statement of defense. Here's how it happened: the fruity editor Benjiboi seeks to impose her queer agenda here at WP, i.e., to include anything and everything related to queerdom whether or not it's notable or sourced. Any editor who questions her edits, additions, ideas, etc., whether or not warranted, is branded a homophobe, or a homophobic vandal (whom she must """"fight""""). Instead of defending her work on the strength of its merits, apparent or lacking, she cleverly, and sometimes not subtly, transforms the issue to: """"if you're not with me, you're against me!"""" And so the focus of the discussion here shifted from whether to include her work to whether Powers is a homophobe, and how dare Powers attack sick, tired Benjiboi. And this arouses everybody's sympathies for poor, poor Benjiboi. Yeah, now it's """"I'm on a break, I'm off to rest from fighting those (omnipresent) homophobic vandals."""" What's next?  """"My white count is way off (so give me what I want)"""" or how about """"I'm throwing up my meds (so let me have my article)?"""" Oh, and how commendable that she still edits here while on break from battle  what dedication! Look, I'll say one thing for Benjiboi: she is a skillful manipulator. But enough of her duplicitous bullshit already, the article will never be anything more than an exhaustive definition. As such it belongs in the dictionary.

 Useful Links for Recycled Lumber   Nina

 Diminishing returns from recycling? 

I propose that Steven Landsburg's arguments be either removed or shown to be refuted by the below logic. I personally think that the argument below, no matter how logical, would be too large to include. Similarly, Landsburg's arguments are provably illogical, and should not be included.

""""Economist Steven Landsburg has claimed that paper recycling actually reduces tree populations. He argues that because paper companies have incentives to replenish the forests they own, large demands for paper lead to large forests. Conversely, reduced demand for paper leads to fewer """"farmed"""" forests.[34] Similar arguments were expressed in a 1995 article for The Free Market.[35]""""

If the variable of incentive to plant new trees is taken to be proportionate to the number of trees required for paper, as this scenario suggests, then the only way that the scenario is true is if it not only assumes that the paper companies are planting fewer trees than they cut, but that more trees are cut down than exist. 

The simplest refutation of the scenario is the model where lumber companies plant as many trees as they cut down. In this case, the number of trees not cut down, due to less paper being required, is immaterial, as the lumber companies would simply plant a number equal to what had been cut. In addition, more old trees would stand.

However, let us pursue the other, and in my opinion more likely, scenario. Companies cut down more trees than they plant. For the sake of simplicity, consider this hypothetical starting state. Forestry companies cut down half existing trees, and replant half of the difference between what stood and and what has been felled, or 25%, for a total of 75% of the original number, if not the original quality, the new trees being young growth. Let us say recycled paper amounts to one half of the trees cut, 12.5%, which would bring the total in terms of usable resource to 87.5%. If it were not added, the next cycle would see the 75% cut, literally, in half, for 37.5%; half is replanted, for a total of 56.25%. If it were added, the 87.5% would be halved to 43.75%, and the company replanting half of that would make a total of 65.625%, almost 10% more trees.

It does not matter whether the companies plant as many as were cut, if they are induced by the remaining forest amount, or a percentage, or induced by the paper supply, or a percentage; it always ends up with less forest cut down. If Landsburg is a notable economist, it speaks ill of economists; he has not exhibited logical reasoning or the capacity o",0,0,0,0,0,0,train

 roman pic 

Here is the entire dicuss from my page (Its funny how you can talk to me on my page but come here and call me a sock   

Your statement: """"image of roman (sic) which cleary state (sic) that """"it is not authentic"""" (sic) and definately (sic) not of hannibal (sic)"""" is OR. 
The text attached to the image clearly states that it is Roman/Capuan and only """"MAY not be"""" an authentic image of Hannibal - not that it is """"not authentic... definately not of hannibal"""", as you so confidently aver. The first statement is sourced, yours is not. If you have a better source, give it. Nor is the image of a """"Roman"""" - the helmet alone is a give-away for that.   

If anyone is doing anything based on opinions it’s you. 1st of all you changed the original writing under the bust to support your illegitimate claim that is vandalism. Also those """"sources"""" you speak of do not support or authenticate that this roman image is of Hannibal in anyway. It would be best if we actually look time out to find an authentic image other than partake in this edit war.

From Adrian Goldsworthy, Cannae p.24 (2001): """"A bust which me be a representation of Hannibal in later life, although there are no definite images of him"""". This reference has been attached to the image for months and has been repeatedly deleted by you, despite my repeated attempts to draw your attention to it. More references follow. The same image appears on the cover of Goldsworthy's The Fall of Carthage (2000) as """"Hannibal in later life"""" and in Goldsworthy's The Complete Roman Army p.41 (2003) as """"A bust that purports to show Hannibal in later life"""". The bust appears also on the cover of Serge Lancel's Hannibal (1995) as """"Roman bust of Hannibal. Museo Archeologico Nazionale. Naples"""". From Philip Matyszak Chronicle of the Roman Republic p.95 (2003): """"Bust, thought to be of Hannibal, found in Capua"""". Brian Todd Carey's Hannibal's Last Battle: Zama and the Fall of Carthage (2007) also uses the image as its cover illustration.

There you go, 5 scholars - and the museum which possesses the bust - all agreeing that the bust either is of Hannibal or may be of Hannibal. Once again, all I ask is that you provide just one source which supports your opinion that the bust """"is not authentic and definately not of hannibal"""", as you so confidently aver. Without a source for this statement, your opinion is nothing but OR.   

Understand that I have a life in the real world, if you leave me a message I will respond to  you when  I can , so please spare the hounding. Anyway you say you want me to provide a source that say the image is not of Hannibal, because you have provided 5 scholarly sources that say otherwise. Well I don’t need to provide a source because, you have already done it and have proven my point. NONE of the “sources” you provided states that the picture is of Hannibal. You yourself said that all the sources you listed said MAYBE the picture if of Hannibal, then you went on to add a quote from one of your “sources” saying “""""A bust which me be a representation of Hannibal in later life, although there are no definite images of him"""". You have basically proven my point if your sources aren’t sure whether or not the image is authentic and you actually have a quote from one saying that there are no definite images of Hannibal then that image should definitely not be there.  

There are 3 views:

1) That the bust IS of Hannibal. 

Supporters: Lancel Hannibal cover (1995): """"Roman bust of Hannibal. Museo Archeologico Nazionale. Naples"""". Goldsworthy, The Fall of Carthage cover (2000): """"Hannibal in later life""""
Carey Hannibal's Last Battle: Zama and the Fall of Carthage cover (2007). 

2) That the bust IS POSSIBLY/PROBABLY of Hannibal. 

Supporters: Matyszak Chronicle of the Roman Republic p.95 (2003): """"Bust, thought to be of Hannibal, found in Capua"""". Goldsworthy The Complete Roman Army p.41 (2003): """"a bust that purports to show Hannibal in later life"""". Goldsworthy Cannae'' p.24 (2004): """"a bust which may be a representation of Hannibal in later life, although there are no definite images of him"""". This citation has been attached to the image for months. 

3) That the bust IS DEFINITELY NOT of Hannibal.

Supporters: You.

Lancel, Carey, and the MA, Naples assert that the image is of Hannibal. Matyszak asserts that it is """"thou",0,0,0,0,0,0,train

Hi there!.. I'm just curious by your recent entry in the Philology introduction. """"The commonality, not the origin or age, of any studied languages, is important, thought those factors are important.""""... Could you add maybe one more line to define what you mean by 'commonality'? Do you mean: commonality of academic opinion? agreed upon terms of what the a particualr word might mean in a historical context? And I'm guessing that the factors you indicate that are important are the origin and age of any given word. I really cant quite see what you might think was insulting about the introduction... (I didnt write it by the way)... I think the point of the intro was to define where the word 'philology' came from... In latin it means 'grammatica'... Greek? I recall that 'philo' means love, and 'logo' ... well i dont know... But the origin of the word i imagine can have a number of sources... That is what makes words interesting and vibrant to me.

Too many lies in this para=
In following para, yogindar sikand is a muslim convert and his name is mentioned as Hindu representative. The first statement is a lie as he is not a hindu representative.

Representatives of Hinduism held a variety of views on Muhammad, some with an assertion that the prophet was none else than the Narashansrishi of the Vedas, predicted in the Atharva Veda.[183] One of the prominent Vaishnava proponents, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada maintained that Mohammad and Jesus, were empowered representatives of God, saktiavesa avataras.[184] In a variety of other points of view, some translated the phrase """"the last prophet"""", suggesting that Vedic deity Agni is none other but Muhammad.[185] In 1926 Siddiq Hussain's two-volume Kannada book, Ja at Guru Sarwar-i 'Alam, argued that the Muhammad was actually Kalki avatar whose arrival had been predicted in the Hindu scriptures, however this view is not a widely accepted doctrine.[186] On the other hand Mirza Ghulani Ahmad argued that Rama and Krishna were prophets of God who had foretold the arrival of Muhammad as God's last law-bearing prophet.[187] Mohammad is sometimes linked to the passage of the Rig Veda declaring that Narashams rishi will arrive as the """"last divine messenger"""" (antim deva duta), who shall """"dispel all darkness"""" and """"conquer death"""".[188]""",0,0,0,0,0,0,train

As for the proper noun ( specifically the noun of the past-historic ), to translate Japanese into English is improper.Because, the English translation way to their Japanese of being common isn't decided.
For example, as for 東京帝國大學醫科大學校, the systematic organization was different from the present University of Tokyo. Or the Aoyama internal medicine (青山内科) is a popular name and is not a formal name.

Tsuki no Misaki
Tsuki no Misaki will become an article with enormous quantity.

""""will"""" is simple future, used to express certainty:
Example: The sun will rise tomorrow
 
That is not certain here. More correctly
Tsuki no Misaki should become an article with enormous quantity. (that which you think is proper)
Tsuki no Misaki may become an article with enormous quantity. (that which you think is possible)
Tsuki no Misaki could become an article with enormous quantity. (that which you think is possible)
Tsuki no Misaki probably will become an article with enormous quantity. (that which you think is strongly possible, but not inevitable)

""""Enormous"""" is usually used for physical things and/or things which are larger than normal or too large:
Humpback whales are enormous mammals.
Global warming is an enormous problem.

Equally important, mere size is not the issue, since Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate (unsorted, unorganized) collection of information. Quality counts, since an encyclopedia is a digest  a summary  of information on topics.

The area may deserve an article: it does NOT deserve a block-by-block and street-by-street description of the entire chome, especially since there is NO organizational principle holding them together. Any reader from outside Tokyo  any reader outside that neighborhood, in fact  will NOT understand in the slightest how any part fits in with any other part.

Agree with Coltsfan. Nobody is saying the overall conflict, which has lasted since 1979, has ended RightCowLeftCoast and that's not actually the topic of this discussion. What we are discussing is that the direct NATO combat involvement phase of the overall Afghan civil war (1979-present) has ended and a new phase has begun just like previously you had: the Soviet phase, the Fall of the communist government, the inter-factional fighting, than the Taliban phase, than the NATO phase (which we are discussing) and now we have a totally new phase of the conflict where the Afghan government takes the lead and NATO and US remnants have a secondary role.   23:24, 8",0,0,0,0,0,0,train

Trolling by Bogdan and Constantzeanu
Bulgar necropoles have been discovered on the following sites: Topola, Durankulak (Dobrich region) and Istria, Obarshia Noua, Izvorul, Sultana in present-day Romania. And this is according to a source from the 1960s, perhaps many more have been found after that date. Should I also remind you that the first Bulgarian capital (Pliska) lies around 50 km from the boundary of Southern Dobruja.

As for the """"Romanian majority"""" in northern Dobruja, we have talked at length with you about this, Bogdan, and such a thing did not exist AT ALL until the beginning of the 20th century and even then the Romanians had ONLY a relative majority.

Let's start from the beginning and move towards what we have. There was a boy who was born in 1805 who founded a religion. That in and of itself isn't that special. Lots of people started their own religions and churches. But he is different. He isn't just any religionist because he claims that he actually speaks with God face-to-face like prophets anciently. He claims that he received Golden Plates and he translated them by the power of God into the Book of Mormon. He claims to hold the keys to salvation. He claims that his is the only church that acts with real authority from God, and that all the other churches are imposters. Aren't you interested in what arguments have been made about whether or not he is a real prophet? If Joseph Smith merely claimed to be able to predict a few things, that would be one thing. But when a young boy claims incredible visions and revelations, comparable only to a handful of previous prophet's experiences, that is something else.  30 June 2005 00:45",0,0,0,0,0,0,train

76064e4c7c37c76a,"Moved to draft space==
I've moved this copypasted pastiche to draft space as it wasn't ready for mainspace.   A few points to remember:

There is nothing to split from the cuisine of Hawaii article.  Splitting occurs when we have too much content and some must be moved elsewhere.  That is not the situation here.  There is nothing to remove from the parent topic.  
What was recommended is for an editor to take up the task of expanding the subject, spinning out the topic into a new daughter article.  This involves an editor who is willing and interested to research and write about the cuisine of Native Hawaiian and to give it an expanded scope and treatment in a larger space.  This means expanding what we already have, not moving it to another article and adding more copypaste from other articles.  Writing means, doing the research, reading the books and scholarly papers, and doing the hard work.  It does not mean taking what we already have and duplicating it over and over again.  That's not how this works.
You basically duplicated the entire cuisine of Hawaii article here.  Since that's a completely different topic, it makes no sense to talk about ethnic and local cuisine here.  If you don't know what the cuisine of Native Hawaii entails, then do the research.  It does not mean any food that anyone of Native Hawaiian ethnicity eats.  It has a specific, pre-contact definition and scope.
When you copied the content, you also copied the sources without adding the actual references.  As a result,  nobody can easily verify the content.  Of course, I can, since I'm the one that went to the library and found the books and cited them in the original article.  You will have to add each full source to this article, otherwise it will get moved back to draft/sandbox space again.  You can't just keep copying material without doing the hard work.  You will need to add each single full reference to this article.  Don't expect others to cleanup after you, especially when other editors did the actual research and footwork you refuse to do.
Per the MOS, please do not surround text with multiple images.  Candleabracadabra, you've been reminded of this many times now.  

Keep this in draft space until you've done the necessary work.  This will involve serious research on your part. It will not involve copying and pasting material from already existing articles.

now back to the task at hand:

now ive figured you all out kindness is the only way to win you over D kindness you shall get my fellow gentlemen )

ahh now you're really showing the love here and not a single piece of that """"wikipedia isn't the place for you"""" mumbo jumbo. guess Travian is not the only one who has changed his attitude a bit now eh? D Travian is glad hes glad. i wasnt aggressive really not in the unblock requests anyway. the rest was for pure unadulterated fun believe it or not but we will get to that part in a minute k?. oh really? nothing i say huh? Travian is sad so sad ( but he'll survive ;) no not really it all stemmed from one thing to another you will see ill try to make you understand this in a most less confusing way as possible k?. im reading it as we speak ill be on it in a few secs. < this reply is to JBW

the following is to my fellow blockee magog: 

yes you may make some suggestions my fellow gentleman D you may be happy to know that ive read them even before i joined wiki and ive read them just now just because you asked so nicely here are the replys in an orderly fashion please take the time to read it my dear sir
 
1. i understand the battleground thing was just a show of enthusiasm we'll get to that in a minute
2. now i dont have a mother(or parents for that matter) but i know where you are getting at: dont try to hurt other peoples feelings or as you may put it or potty it ;)  dont be a potty mouth
3. ( now this is the part Travian has a little problem with i feel that you should have been a wee bit more lenient with me on my first block(not this one) you should have warned me before blocking since it was my first time anyway but i guess blocking all those other vandals has some kind of a PTSD effect on wiki admins dont worry ill make the explanation short  please tolerate Travian he only made 4 reverts he was warned ONLY once for reverting 3 times and at that time he didnt check his talk page so he didnt know if he had a warning as he was busy browsing but that wasnt a violation it was a fair warning no doubt but... at that exact time i was going to modify my 4th edit(it was not a revert) so naturally i wouldnt be able to see the warning i only saw the orange message after i finished editing and saved the page after i did that i got another warning only it wasnt a warning it said that i have been reported for editting 4 times boy did i wish it was a warning though P now i felt that i deserved a warning before i got blocked a warning by YOU yourself we are all guys here arent we (even though im 12 i still do count D ) my point is we are all reasonable men here i would have stopped had i known that i was doing harm and not the good i envisioned. so please i would like to ask you tolerate me of you will ill talk more about this below
4. oh i humbly apologize but its just that that situation was unique that particular user wasnt going to listen anyway but believe me another user spoke to him giving a link to disprove his point but he kept insisting he was right i assumed good faith in that had he seen that link he would not have continued with his points (as he had been reverted by many others before too) but i was clearly wrong on that part so i reverted his edits and he kept reverting mine so i posted a comment on his talk page only to get insulted. i would have welcomed him with the """"welcome to wikipedia"""" thingy with the pretty pictures but alas i had no knowledge of how to do that. but i did make a little mistake though that comment i made may have been a bit personal but it was not an attack no was it insulting but it was accurate notheless and when he insulted me back i thought of ignoring him but knowing that he could easily be aggravated i just couldn't pass this offer up just for the giggles but i know when im guilty regardless of  reason if you may ask why i did it i would answer with IDIFTL D
5.mastodon lol thats funny(did you know scientists are running an extinct cloning program? so the mastodons might indeed be coming back) oh no no my fellow editor you got it all wrong i wasnt really angry i did it for the laughs it was funny even if it was a little bit after all creating a page with """"hairy monkey balls"""" did make me giggle P i hope someone besides me got some laughs ;) but alas i know when ive done something bad read the """"in a nutshell"""" part for details of you are confused

yes ive read them now i cant guarantee that but i promise i will not be a potty mouth k? i cannot guarantee the other part because i may accidentaly edit 4 times in a row but i want you to be a bit lenient with me on this last part now ive seen people right here on wiki who made more than 10 reverts not get immediately bloc",0,0,0,0,0,0,train

a melancholic song about unrequited love, especially because it’s all crescendo and no denouement: Listeners never find out if the main character actually gets her wish—much less if the person she’s confessing her love to actually feels the same way. “All I Want For Christmas Is You” is a one-sided confession of wants and desires, not a song describing or celebrating a consummated relationship. “Honestly, the lyrics, to me, come off as hopelessly sad,” Williems says.  “I’ve read the critical reception section of the song’s Wikipedia page, and I can’t help but think the critics weren’t really listening. One critic seems to claim there is a ‘hint of longing,’ which might be the understatement of the century.

If you wanted to get real bummed about it, I think the argument could be made that the song is denouncing the artificiality surrounding the spectacle of Christmas,” he continues. “Saying that you are so hung up on the negative of not being with one person on Christmas that you can’t embrace the joy of the holiday is really pretty sad, but also movingly honest for a pop Christmas song.

Kent wrongly describes the Sathya Sai Baba movement in Malaysia as a """"Hindu Revitalization movement."""" Whilst local Hindu practices have indeed been encouraged, it would be wrong to use this term because Sai Baba has encouraged people of all religions to adhere to their own religions and has often quoted from the Bible and the Koran in his discourses.

 Response to Skinwalker's personal attack on  via a RFC  

Hi

This is a response to 's RFC on .

Rather than straight talking language, some folk prefer to use clever legalistic attacks on individuals such as the way that  is using on .

In the context of the Wiki, this is an ad hominem where his intellectual powers failed to persuade the consensus on the discussion page.

 failed to get his way with regard to muddying of the waters with anorexia just as   had done previously with the met industry's pollution. So what happened her is they conspired to attack  with the use of a meatpuppet called   employing all the trick they can like making false allegation, lying, official complaints and so on.

I would like to point out that in British English the word nark is non-pejorative and I understand that it has an objective meaning something akin to a """" snitch """" in American. That is, meaning someone that makes, often erroneous, allegations to authorities in order to personally benefit themselves in some way. It is certianly a lot less intentionally insulting than to be continuously called a meatpuppet or, I am sure, for user Canaen to be accused of having some connection with me when he has none.

The funniest thing for me is that  is busy digging a hole in his own canoe because his allegations are outright lies of which he can in no way substantiate.

This conflict started because  insisted on posting data refering to anorexics on the Vegan topic which had no relationship to veganism whatsoever.

 is entirely wrong. I know this because I know who I am and I know with whom I have and have had connections and I take a very minor little offence at being accused by the likes of you of being something I am not. I state """" very minor little offence """" because you and your views genuinely are so unimportant. 

  is an individual of very little decency and integrity. I do not state this as an insult but as an objective statement.   has been told on many occasions that I have no connection with this or the other individuals and yet he not only continue to go on making such allegations but   even uses them as the ground to make an attack on another individual.
 

This is where   boasts to Canaen he has made a complaint about him on Canaen user page ;

User conduct RFC

Please be advised that I have filed a user conduct RFC on you.  It can be found  here.  Cheers,  

This is where I - as one of the erroneiously accused """" meatpuppets """" respond ;

Just out of interest, who do you think this nark  is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing? I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and, frankly, I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not. I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.

Unfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity. 

 Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods. 

I am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down, connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so-called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine. 

And what of ? He just seems to get off on throwing around his weight whilst avoiding entering into the actually factual discussion.

For the record - and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome, let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks - I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and, arguably, MacDonald of Clanranald. I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently.

You say """"I would suggest Hibernian that you or someone make a file of the Wilton Ivey piece, and use that in reference to Urban Planning."""", but that is essentially what is already there, the Urbanates article was mostly written in reference to the ideas Wilton Ivey, etc. If you want a longer section about what a Technate might do with cities before it replaces them with Urbanates (which would likely take decades to build), then be my guest if you know some specifics about it.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.71.74.87.105

I assume good faith on your part, UserQuiddity, because you have always been a gentleman. Accordingly either you are mistaken, or Wikipedia is subject to easy fandalism, because the facts, as I know them are substantially different from your presentation. The page in question is Jewish Bolshevism, which is a so called noun + adjetive expression (according to Wikipedians). The fact is that those who explain or justify the hatred of Jews are crackpots and Antisemites. My position is simple: Jewish Bolshivism has only an antisemitic meaning, interpretation, usage, justification, etc. I am not responsible for the fact that that Draius/red (whatever his difficult to remember name is) user deduced that I have insulted him. The insult was his own deduction. I did not hurl at him any insult. And that term popsucker is just my paraphrase of the other dofficult Wiki word for a Wikipedia who disguises his identity. I am not allowed to name any of the people I suspect - what's that word, I don't know, and I do not wish to waste my time looking for it - it sounds something like suckpoper - can you help me out on this? Also, I can no longer locate the Wikipedia linked expression Don't be a dick. Can you please provide me with the link to it.

National Journal rates Obama the single """"most liberal"""" member of the Senate last year, spotlighting some policy differences, as well as writing a GOP attack ad if he's the nominee, but perhaps also a helpful note in consolidating support on the left now.

The rating is a detailed, rigorous look across candidates' Senate records, and while Obama and Clinton are perceived as having similar Senate records, this suggests that Obama's record on the smaller, little-noticed votes has put him firmly to Clinton's left.

I continue to disagree. Other articles demonstrate that it is entirely possible to have readable, easy-to-use tables with sufficient numbers of columns to display results for all the parties under discussion. They also show techniques to deal with parties sometimes being reported and sometimes not, and sometimes being reported together. There is no need for the opinion polling table to be so abbreviated. Thus, we should reflect what the citations say. If polls are released that lump everyone other than the four biggest parties as """"other"""", that's fine  we report """"other"""". If polls are released that give results for the Greens, BNP etc., then we should report those. We should be doing our best to avoid a situation where we are in danger of original research: I understand the 'cliff edge' argument, but that approach should be a last resort. We should take our lead from reliable sources, as always.

711197c33f14d029,"Sails as wings? 

I think that this might be an oversimplification of the matter, as it depends largely on both the type of rigging being used and the direction (relevant to the wind direction) that one wishs to go.

For instance, many of the large square rigged ships did move essentially through the force of the wind pushing on the sail. I suppose technically the wind is piling up behind the sail (thus high pressure area) and the difference in pressure between the higher and lower pressure areas on opposite sides of the sail causes it to move, which is the same principle as that which generates lift. However, unlike in the case of aerofoils (aka wings) there is *not* a higher wind speed going across the back of the sail than the front.

In short, while the pressure differential as cause of movement remains valid, the cause of these pressure differences is not the same as for wings.

Lift (force)

Anyway, hope this helps.

Information needing to be inserted into the article
The translation needs to be continued, and the result wikified and styled. Taken from here. Moved here because Markstreet reverted the article for the 15th time, and I already reverted two times. 

As the Transnistrian referendum deadline approaches, to the support for the separatists from Tiraspol comes disinformation not only from press agencies, but also campaigns in the purest KGB style. This years June month, several publications from Russia and Transdniester made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts”, a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern Moldova. The study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names: """"International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS; where Mauco leads) and """"Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group"""". Among the signatures were quoted several well-known Oxford, Standford or Harvard: Stefan Talmon, Christopher Goebel, Nancy Furman, Paul Williams, Stephen Krasner, Andrew Lorenz, Michael Scharf, William Wookd. These were said to have participated in April 2006, at a conference at the Bacon Hotel in Washington, together with several other experts in international law, among which a high ranking official of the US State Department. They all concluded that “Transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state”, thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. The Ziua reporters contacted the quoted professors. Astounded, they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the Russian press. Stephen Krasner, professor of international relations at Stanford University declared that he didn`t even wrote about Transdniester ever. Michael Scharf, professor at Case Western University, transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of Paul Williams, written over a decade ago, not about Transdniester, but about Nagorno Karabah. Stefan Talmon, professor an Oxford University declared: “I want to make it clear that I was not involved in the writing of this report. I suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report, and to deceive the public”. Ziuas investigation was taken over and continued by the The Economist. After studing the text of the report, the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language, certain expressions betrayed the fact that English was not the maternal language of the authors. For example, the use of the expression """"telephone centrals"""" instead of """"exchanges"""" is a very common error found in Russian to English translations.The surprises continued. The british journalists found that at the Bacon Hotel in Washington had not taken place any such conference. None of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. About the two organizations which created the study, the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange. From the so called Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group it appears that there is nothing except the organizations label, informs the Economist in its 3rd August edition, in an article called """"Propaganda Wars Returns"""".

The reason that punk rock had been given as a genre was because it was the most commonly used term given in articles about the band, rather than rap rock, a term that is not used by the band. While it has been argued that Rolling Stone is a stronger source than some of the others, it should be noted that these reviews were written, as previously noted, during the period in which the band was signed to a major label, when the band received more coverage than it has while recording and releasing albums independently, and sources agree that the majority of the band's works (its debut EP, debut album, and all independent releases) reflect a punk influence, rather than a metal influence, and most certainly the band's most recent work is considered to be punk-influenced. Thus, taking into consideration that the majority and most recent of the band's works is considered to be punk rock, I feel that this is the genre that should  be given in the lead.

Even the sort of people who hate Ayn still have to admit to at least some of the things that she, objectively, got right. I love watching liberals try to knock her, then mutter under their breath that they have her to thank for freeing them from theism! So defending some aspects of Ayn's ideas doesn't earn Smith any badge of honor.

1. Removed the info on Falcon X Heavy and Falcon XX, since those are just proposed concepts that haven't yet reached nowhere near the project stage. 2. Removed the info stating that Saturn INT-21 had one launch. It has never flown, the booster used for Skylab was an actual Saturn V with the 3rd stage modified into Skylab itself. The entry for Saturn INT-21 should probably be deleted altogether, but unlike two heavy Falcons it was under development coming much closer to becoming an operational vehicle, so I'm not sure. 3. Added clarification to Space Shuttle entry that it is regarded here as an integrated launch system, and not a standalone heavy booster, also removed the note stating:  'Like Soviet Energia-Buran system, despite of integrated design of rocket and orbiter, US Space Shuttle may be comparatively considered as launcher for such superheavy payload as manned spaceplane. But it should be noted that the orbiter could not hold more tha 25,000 kg.'  Such reasoning is not entirely justified. It can be considered as such only with serious reservations, since Shuttle's Orbiter acts de facto as a returnable third stage which cannot be replaced with anything else and has to be brought back to Earth, whereas other boosters can hypothetically (or practically, like Saturn V - Skylab case) have the load they put in LEO modified.  And certainly the Shuttle system cannot be part of this comparative list based on similarity with Energia-Buran (the note says 'like Soviet Energia-Buran system') since Enegia booster could be adapted to carry basically any appropriately configured and balanced payload piggybacked on its side, not just the orbiter.",0,0,0,0,0,0,test

To expand on one aspect of that: Wikipedia's three main content policies are:
WP:Neutral point of view, which Peridon mentioned,
WP:Verifiability: """"all quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source... The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—whether readers can check that material in Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether editors think it is true.""""
WP:No original research: """"The term """"original research"""" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published source exists.""""
The last two mean that content based on your """"extensive participation in two of the three events (making me VERY knowledgeable of what occurred both in public and private, with a bare minimum of conjecture)"""" is not acceptable as a basis for additions to the article.

 Hi 

Dear Mr. 147.252.223.38.

Please do not vandalize like you did to Fourier inversion formula. Math is a wonderful subject even if you don't appreciate it. Mathematicians do something useful for the world and what they do lasts for centuries. They also enjoy what they do. If, by """"get a life"""", you mean """"go to parties, get drunk, and crash your car into another car and die"""", then it's obvious to anyone with a modicum of intelligence that mathematics is far superior.

Also, you have no right to criticize people who do math unless you yourself can understand what they do. The mathematics you have criticized is deep and interesting and you shouldn't insult it unless you understand it. I hate the mentality that if you don't understand something you need to criticize it. It tells more about you than it does about the people who do math.

The 'gender gap' will never be closed unless Wikipedia becomes a place for women to gossip and socialize with each other on. The only 'cultural bias' Wikipedia has is that it is 'biased' towards objectively important subjects such as science, which coincidentally happen to be those pursued until recently by the Western society, which incidentally has always been the only culture around at all.

Insisting on 'equal coverage' of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and non-notable people.

 This is the English version of Wikipedia! Adjust yourself to that fact or go somewhere else. 

Why are English speakers always barraged by racists trying to insist that we use their language? Especially Spanish and Arabic. This is the English version of Wikipedia, and it should be written in English. Why do these racists always try to cram Spanish down our throats? Everyone in the world has a language. Yours is not better than mine. In fact, it is inferior. Speak, read and write Spanish if you want. And use the Spanish-language version of Wikipedia. I don't care. But stop harassing me! This page is not nearly as bad as many others, but I am fed up with this practice. The leading paragraph of some topics is virtually unreadable because a translation has been added for almost every word.

In this article the leading paragraph provides the asinine translation found in this sentence: """"He is the founder of Ricky Martín Foundation (in Spanish Fundación Ricky Martin), a non-profit charity organization."""" To begin with, a moderately mentally-retarded person, who doesn't speak either language, could probably figure that out. There is no legitimate reason for this translation. And why the racial prejudice? Where is the Russian translation? What about German, Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc? The logical conclusion of this absurdity will be that every word of the English article will be followed by its Spanish counterpart. Insanity! We don't vandalize their wiki; they should stop vandalizing ours.

I checked the Spanish-language wiki for this article, and it contains no translation into English. That is appropriate. This version should contain no translations into Spanish, unless the Spanish wiki is shut down completely. Then it would be acceptable to include a few pertinent translations. However, this instance is completely pointless.

Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts.

Fanboy is a term used to describe an individual (usually male; the feminine version fangirl may be used for females) who is utterly devoted to a single fannish subject, or to a single point of view within that subject, often to the point where it is considered an obsession. Fanboys remain loyal to their particular obsession, disregarding any factors (often including logic) that differ from their point of view. 

 Background 
Stereotypical fanboys are attributed with a sycophantic devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled. Fanboys are noted for a very emotional attachment to their chosen subject, often taking negative remarks about it as a personal attack. They will readily engage in debates, but will fall back on emotional responses when challenged on facts. For example, a fanboy may go out of his way to point out negative and often untrue statements about their obsession's rivals. Fanboys are often hostile towards critical review of their chosen subject. The stereotypical image of the fanboy is as an unkempt, socially awkward young man who may be perceived as a loud mouthed pseudo-intellectual. Fanboys  are also typically aggressive and hateful towards the opposing brand or competition of their obsession regardless of its merits or achievements. 

As electronic entertainment gained popularity, the term became increasingly applied to video game and television addicts. As a result, a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as """"fanboys."""" Within this group, more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard, resulting in a more outgoing attitude, even among those with insecurities. This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply. The term originated in comic book circles, to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom.  The term is often used in a derogatory manner by other less obsessed fans. The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex.

The term fangirl, while similar, often carries slightly different connotations. The term fangirl is often applied to any enthusiastic female fan, regardless of obsessive qualities or not, and is often used with overtones of """"teenybopper"""".

History of fanboys and the term
The term """"fanboy"""" is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex. It is often used in a derogatory manner by other, less obsessed fans. The term originated in comic book circles to describe someone immersed in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom. Common subjects of reverence by fanboys are specific: TV shows; movies; music; anime; comic books; cars; video game consoles, video games and MMORPGs; and computer operating systems, hardware and software.
 
Popular depictions of Fanboy stereotypes include the Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons and columnist Larry Groznic from the satirical newspaper The Onion.  In the songs of the fannish parody musician Luke Ski, many characters proudly consider themselves fanboys.

The earliest published uses of the word """"fanboy"""" have been dated to 1982.  One reference is to the cover of the """"Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide"""".  On this cover page are sketched overweight, overzealous comic book collectors wearing T-shirts that state """"Fanboys of America,"""" who are describing the extreme measures they would go to, including moving to San Francisco, to preserve their comics.

I urge you to delete the reference stating that the Article was about a real person, which not etc. etc. 

Are you implying that I lack importance or even significance, because a Wiki page did not utterly describe me. I did not publish the page about myself, and when I saw it years ago, I left it at that. I only checked if the facts were OK and over the years somebody sometimes helped me to make a few changes. But I never bothered about it so much as to expand it by adding all kinds of sources. no need. 
My relevance is not to be measured by how many articles I published in your country, because I was never a journalist in your country. In fact, you wouldn´t even be able to understand anything I wrote because I am not even English speaking. You are clearly going by double standards here.  When a Wiki editor uses words like crap whenever editing pages about living people, credible people with a solid track record, that in itself is UNACCEPTABLE. And I was not the only one complaining about ´´him´´.
Also, please be aware of the FACT that there are a number of pages, people with my similar background, cultural background that is, who have even less data. And there is nothing wrong with that, because among ourselves we know our importance. Nobody from out of nowhere will come in and refer to it as CRAP. I was attacked by a stalker yesterday and I called it to Wiki´s attention because it was one crazy addition to the page. The stalker even changed my nationality, changing me into a Caribbean national which I am most definitely not. I guess that kind of gibberish will prompt the creeps to come out and complete the feast.

 Traditional or Simplified Chinese? 

I've moved this to a new section because it has become difficult to continue two topics in the same section. I would like to discuss what should be done about the issue of Traditional and Simplified Chinese in TW related articles (without discussing romanisation methods). My aim is just to get a consensus (either way), and not simply to push my ideas on wiki. I have tried posting similar topics in the HK page as well as the manual of style, but it seems hard to have an active discussion let alone get any real consensus. 

Why are we still including both sets in these articles?

Naturally I support removing simplified Chinese from TW related articles. It is just as misleading to include traditional chinese in the PRC article as it is to include simplified chinese in the ROC article. I am not talking about matters of race or cultural identity, but about de facto usage. Users in the pinyin section have argued (quite well) that hanyu pinyin should be included in ROC articles because it is used de facto, even in TW. So why then can't we eliminate simplified chinese from the TW related articles as TW's de facto standard is traditional chinese only? Wiki is not a chinese dictionary, so is there any reason to include TW and PRC's writing systems in the articles of the other? This doesn't have anything to do with anyone's personal views on """"one china"""" or """"two chinas"""", but rather is an issue of reflecting the language situation in both areas and cleaning up articles.
